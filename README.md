# Machine-Learning-Text-Analytics

Goal is to identify which questions asked on Quora, a website, are duplicates of questions that have already been asked. Our focus for this assignment will be to learn how to create features from a textual data. Using some inherent knowledge of text and certain feature generation techniques will be used.

~This is part of self learning.
